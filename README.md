# Correlation Power Attacks on Public Datasets

The current repository houses the CPA tool implementation created as a product of my Bachelor thesis.

Each Jupyter notebook is associated with a corresponding dataset:
- ASCAD.ipynb performs and evaluated CPA on [ASCADv1](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/ascad/)
- random-delays.ipynb is based on dataset [randomdelays-traces](https://github.com/ikizhvatov/randomdelays-traces)
- AES HD is utilizes dataset from [AES HD](https://github.com/AESHD/AES_HD_Dataset)
